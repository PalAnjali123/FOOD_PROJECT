# FOOD_PROJECT
A food delivery app is a digital platform that allows users to order meals from local restaurants and have them delivered to their doorstep.
Users can browse menus, customize orders, and make secure payments through the app. 
It offers convenience, especially for those with busy schedules or limited mobility.
Restaurants benefit from increased visibility and a broader customer base.
